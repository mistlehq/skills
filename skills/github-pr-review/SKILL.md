description: Review a GitHub pull request from live PR state, follow the real code path, and post precise inline review comments with gh api plus PR-level comments with gh pr comment.
---

## Start

Use live PR state. Run `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff` before reviewing.
Read repo-local review, test, contribution, or maintainer instructions that apply to the changed files.

## Reconstruct Scope

Before judging the PR, determine:

- ref: PR number/url, base, and head
- surface: runtime, CLI, provider, channel, docs, tests, config, dependency, or mixed
- change type: bug fix, feature, refactor, config/runtime, dependency, docs, test-only, or mixed
- intent: what the PR is trying to change, based on PR text, issues, commits, tests, and diff
- boundary: where the behavior should live and whether ownership/abstraction is right
- implementation path: production path traced and confidence level

## Review Method

Trace every changed behavior through its production path to the affected boundary.

Use the relevant path:

- runtime: entrypoint -> validation/parsing -> dispatch -> owner module -> shared helper -> persistence/network/runtime boundary
- config/docs: schema/docs -> runtime use -> validation/doctor/migration/recovery path
- provider/plugin/channel: owner implementation first, generic core only when multiple owners need it
- tests: touched tests plus adjacent regression coverage

Use source, executable checks, current docs, package types, and dependency contracts as proof. Treat PR comments, old CI, and old behavior reports as hints until verified.

## Review Standard

For all PRs, check:

- correct ownership boundary
- intended public/backward-compatible behavior
- clear invariant, workflow, or contract
- proof at the narrowest layer that would fail for the regression
- docs/setup/examples when user-visible behavior changes
- explicit runtime failure or established repair path
- no broad special cases, hidden migrations, magic sentinels, or provider/channel IDs in generic core

Judge by change type:

- bug fix: broken behavior, code-level root cause, cause-level vs symptom-level fix, and whether a small refactor would clarify the invariant without widening risk
- feature: workflow completeness, state model, compatibility, docs, regression coverage
- refactor: preserved behavior, clearer ownership, lower complexity, unchanged contracts
- config/runtime: schema, defaults, runtime use, docs, validation, repair path
- dependency: current upstream contract, version compatibility, approved failure behavior, tests
- docs: accuracy against shipped behavior and no unsupported promises
- test-only: protects real behavior rather than incidental implementation

Call out symptom-only fixes, wrong-layer complexity, and changes that make future behavior harder to reason about. Recommend a larger refactor only when it clarifies an invariant, reduces repeated bug classes, or improves ownership without widening risk; if the refactor adds risk without improving the change class, say so.

## Findings And Publish

Lead with findings.

Each finding must include:

- file and changed line when anchorable, or symbol when not anchorable
- concrete failure mode
- impact
- smallest recommended fix

If there are no blocking findings, say:

- no blocking correctness issues found
- strongest proof checked
- residual risk or test gaps
- whether the structure is acceptable for this scope

If verification fails, say what was attempted, the shortest useful failure summary, whether it appears caused by the PR or by the environment, and how it affects confidence. Do not report it as a code finding unless it traces to the changed code; otherwise include it under proof gaps or residual risk.

Publish by default unless the user asks for dry-run, preview, or local-only review.

Route findings by anchor:

- exact changed-line finding: post an inline review comment with `gh api`
- architectural, cross-file, non-diff, or unanchorable finding: include it in the PR-level comment with file/symbol references
- overall result, proof checked, residual risk, judgment, and broad questions: post one PR-level comment with `gh pr comment`

Post inline comments first, then the PR-level summary.
